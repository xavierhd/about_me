Curious and life-loving engineer, programmer, and manager, I dream of improving peopleâ€™s quality of life and societyâ€™s productivity by cutting waste, optimizing mobility and resource use, and making products and services more circular. I want to work with people who share my passion for freedom of choice, who believe in offering more options instead of dumbing services down, who value playful learning and ease of use, where a clear "why" and a simple "how" guide the user experience. I care deeply about privacy; to me, the client should remain a client, not become the product.
